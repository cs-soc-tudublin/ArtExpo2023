## Rules & Recommendations

If you want your code merged, follow these rules!

* Source code only : Only submit source code + instructions on how to compile/run it and any build scripts etc.
* Pick your tools : While we teach processing in Creative Coding, please feel free to use languages and frameworks that you're most comfortable with. This is about self expression through code so use the tools you think best fit the job. Please stick to free tools where possible.
* Limit the use of pre-rendered assets : There are thousands of art expos yearly by people who draw things digitally or analogue. We want to express ourselves through code, although if you have pre-rendered assets as a component of your work, that's perfectly fine.

Some recommendations and guidance.
* Get inspired : There's lots of resources online to do with creative coding and what people have made before. Use that to your advantage to convert your ideas to code.
* Ask questions : We have a wonderful community of smart and talented individuals who are extremely helpful. If you have a question, it's extremely likely someone will have an answer, if not then you'll have fun solving problems together!
* Push to your branch as often as you can.
* Help eachother : Give feedback to your fellow contributors and be welcoming of feedback as well.
